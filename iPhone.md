# iPhone

This is a current running list of issues with my phone. I would love for some smart people at phone companies to fix these issues, but really it's just a way for me to explain to my brother why iPhones aren't all they're cracked up to be.

## Philosophy

Here's my thing on tools. It exists to get a job done. It doesn't have to be shiny, or fancy, or insanely expensive. It simply needs to do a few things really well.

I tend to use the same tools until they break or deliver an inferior experience. There might be better tools out there by now, but I rarely have the time to re-assess the dozens of tools I rely on every few weeks.

Take Apple Maps for an example. When it came out, circa iOS 6, I really wanted it to succeed. Good on you, Apple, for figuring this out. It's a really hard problem to solve. But it was a disaster. Google delivered a polished, finished product a few weeks after iOS 6 launched. I've been using that ever since.

I'm sure Apple Maps has improved a lot over the last few years. But Google Maps does everything I need and is free to use. Until Google changes their mind on pricing or screws up their software in a terrible way, I'm not going to bother looking at other options. I'd rather spend my time at the dog park, or going to the beach, or trying a new coffee shop or reading a new book.

## Current Phone

* iPhone SE
* 64 GB
* Space Grey
* iOS 12.1.4

## Good things
* Form factor is excellent.
* Battery life is very good, considering its 3+ years old.
* Standardized 3.5mm headphone port.
* Lightning cable is nice because its reversable.
* iOS / Apple tends to care about your privacy. At least they say they do, which is more than what other companies have done. There are companies like Silent Circle, but no one uses them and their security model depends on everyone using their proprietary devices, which is never going to happen.


## Bad Things
* Low power mode should be on all the time. It disables all the stuff I don't care about (background app refresh, email fetch [who uses the default email client???], etc).
* Cannot set default applications. I'm looking at you, Apple Maps. Sorry, but I will use Google Maps for as long as they don't screw it up.
* Newer iPhones put this model's camera to shame.
* Can't download things when it's locked. Or it does, but cancels them after two minutes. Sometimes I want to download a very big Spotify playlist without having to have my phone's screen lit up all the time.
* Annoying pop ups saying to enable wifi for improved location accuracy. I remember installing a jailbreak mod to disable all these.
* The volume icon. It takes up the entire screen! YouTube figured this out like a year ago, maybe more. Get it together, Apple.
* Incoming calls always take up the entire screen. I would prefer a banner notification, the same way any other app does it. That way it doesn't interrupt whatever I'm currently doing. Since most calls I get are robocalls, I usually dismiss them anyways.
* Not having a Mac makes a lot of features useless. AirDrop, Handoff, and Car Play are all useless to me. Make these work with Windows. You did it once before with Safari.
* Password manager. Is this cross platform yet? Can I access it on a Linux and Windows box? Until then I will not consider using it. KeepassXC is cross platform, but doesn't work all that well on a mobile device. So for now I just manually type in long complicated passwords once when I log into an app or something. It's a bit annoying but not the end of the world.
* Spotify has gotten slow recently. Not sure if this is an issue with Spotify or my phone is just starting to show its age.
  * Ripping out headphones causes the music to continue playing for 1-2 seconds. It should stop instantly.
  * Pausing it on the lock screen, then unlocking it. The app still shows as playing, even though there is no sound.
  * Spotify insists on playing videos. On a phone. With limited storage and data plans. this is off topic but it really bothers me.
